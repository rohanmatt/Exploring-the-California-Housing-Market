# California Housing Market Analysis

## Introduction

The California Housing Market Analysis application is an interactive web-based tool built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating data visualization and machine learning web applications. The primary goal of this application is to explore the factors influencing median house values in California through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and insightful visualizations.

## Features

- **Storytelling Experience**: The application presents the analysis in a narrative format, guiding users through the insights and visualizations.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Users can explore various visualizations, including scatter plots, pair plots, box plots, and heatmaps, to understand the relationships between features and their impact on median house values.
- **User Interaction**: Users can interact with the application by clicking a button to view summary statistics of the dataset.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, with a consistent blue theme and custom styling.
- **Modular Structure**: The application follows a modular structure, with the CSS styles stored in a separate file for easy maintenance and modification.
